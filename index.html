            <p>So many people won’t even consider experiencing a solo travel tour for a number of reasons. Maybe they fear it being unsafe, especially as a woman, travelling alone. Some worry they’ll grow bored. Others think the cost of exploring as a ‘single’ is too high. All valid concerns. I’ve had them myself. But it’s never stopped me. And here's why it shouldn’t stop you too. 

            Here's the thing: we live in a busy world. Everybody seems to have a million and one things occupying their attention and time now, don’t they? You can’t tell me you haven’t messaged back and forth with at least one friend, both of your diaries open, as you desperately try to find a night where you’re both free to have dinner with one another.
            
            Now imagine trying to organise a holiday or small-group tour with them. Or multiple friends. Likely, you’ve already had this experience.
            
            And if you’ve got the free time, or the desire, to go on a UK or even a European trip... why should you have to wait? Or compromise? Sometimes there’s a thrill in planning a holiday with someone, to share that excitement as the trip approaches, imagining the adventures you will experience together. 
            
            But there’s another thrill I want – no, need – you to experience. Solo travelling. Knowing that you’re about to disappear on your own into the wilderness of some overrun landscape, or into the electrifying commotion of a foreign city... It's like having a secret. <a href=""><button>Read more</button></a></p>
